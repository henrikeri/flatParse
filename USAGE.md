# Building and Running FlatMaster

## Prerequisites

1. **.NET 8 SDK** - [Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
2. **Visual Studio 2022** (recommended) or VS Code with C# extension
3. **Windows 10/11** (WPF requirement)
4. **PixInsight 1.8.9+** (for processing)

## Quick Start

### 1. Restore Dependencies

```powershell
dotnet restore
```

### 2. Build Solution

```powershell
dotnet build
```

### 3. Run Application

```powershell
dotnet run --project src/FlatMaster.WPF
```

Or open `FlatMaster.sln` in Visual Studio and press F5.

## Matching existing and newly added flats

Scan the input roots with the intended output folder selected, then run matching.
Matching Details shows every scanned group, with included groups sorted first.
Completed outputs default to unchecked; checking Include explicitly allows reprocessing.

The summary counts completed, included, changed, and failed groups. Use Include
pending to select work needing attention, Clear inclusion to uncheck everything,
or Ctrl/Shift-select rows and choose Include selected rows. Hover over Output
status for details and use Open master to open an available output through its
Windows file association.

New masters store their input inventory and camera settings in an adjacent
`.meta.json` file. Attempt records live in `.FlatMaster` under the mirrored output
directory. Keep these files with the outputs. On the next scan, added, removed,
or modified inputs appear as Changed inputs; interrupted or failed attempts
appear as Failed. Older masters without a recorded inventory remain Completed,
with an explanatory tooltip. Reprocessing them creates provenance for future
comparisons.

Processing retains the full matching list afterward. Successfully completed
groups return to unchecked, while reports describe only the groups in that run.

```

## Configuration

Edit `appsettings.json` in the WPF project:

```json
{
  "AppSettings": {
    "PixInsightExecutable": "C:\\Program Files\\PixInsight\\bin\\PixInsight.exe",
    "MaxThreads": 8
  },
  "ProcessingDefaults": {
    "DeleteCalibratedFlats": true,
    "RejectionLowSigma": 5.0,
    "RejectionHighSigma": 5.0
  },
  "DarkMatching": {
    "EnforceBinning": true,
    "PreferSameGainOffset": true,
    "MaxTempDeltaC": 5.0
  }
}
```

## Usage Workflow

### 1. Add Flat Base Directories
- Click **"+ Add"** under "Flat Base Directories"
- Select folders containing flat frames (will scan recursively)

### 2. Add Dark Library Directories
- Click **"+ Add"** under "Dark Library Directories"
- Select folders containing dark/dark-flat frames

### 3. Scan Files
- Click **"🔍 Scan Flat Directories"** to discover flat frames
- Click **"🔍 Scan Dark Library"** to catalog darks
- Review discovered files in the right panels

### 4. Select What to Process
- Check/uncheck directories and darks as needed
- Use "✓ All" and "✗ None" buttons for batch selection

### 5. Process
- Configure PixInsight path if needed
- Click **"▶️ Process Selected"**
- Monitor progress in the log window

### 6. Results
- Master flats saved in `{BaseDir}_processed/` with mirrored structure
- Format: `MasterFlat_{DATE}_{FILTER}_{EXPOSURE}s.xisf`
- Calibrated intermediates deleted (if option checked)

## Running Tests

```powershell
dotnet test
```

## Troubleshooting

### "PixInsight executable not found"
- Verify path in Settings
- Default: `C:\Program Files\PixInsight\bin\PixInsight.exe`

### "No suitable dark found"
- Check dark inventory has matching exposures
- Enable "Allow nearest exposure with optimize" in config
- Verify dark files are selected (checked)

### "Skipping directory: no exposure groups with >=3 files"
- Each exposure needs at least 3 flats for integration
- Check filename patterns if exposure not detected
- Exposures detected from FITS headers or filenames (e.g., `flat_1.5s.fits`)

### Metadata not reading correctly
- Ensure files are valid FITS/XISF format
- Check FITS keywords: EXPTIME, XBINNING, GAIN, OFFSET
- XISF properties/FITSKeywords parsed from XML header

## Performance Tips

1. **Parallel Processing**: Set `MaxThreads` in config (default: 8)
2. **Network Drives**: Copy files locally for faster scanning
3. **Large Libraries**: Use specific dark roots instead of top-level
4. **Filters**: Organize flats by filter in separate folders

## Architecture Notes

### Design Patterns
- **MVVM**: Clean separation of UI and logic
- **Dependency Injection**: Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstracted file operations
- **Async/Await**: Non-blocking UI during operations

### Key Services
- `IMetadataReaderService`: FITS/XISF header parsing
- `IFileScannerService`: Recursive directory scanning
- `IDarkMatchingService`: Intelligent dark frame selection
- `IPixInsightService`: PJSR generation and execution

### PixInsight Integration
- Generates PJSR (JavaScript) scripts dynamically
- Configures ImageIntegration with WBPP-like parameters
- Handles ImageCalibration with dark optimization
- Robust file saving with fallback strategies

## Extending

### Adding New Metadata Fields
1. Update `ImageMetadata` in Core
2. Add parsing logic in `MetadataReaderService`
3. Update `MatchingCriteria` if needed for dark matching

### Custom Processing Options
1. Modify `ProcessingConfiguration` in Core
2. Update `appsettings.json` schema
3. Pass through to PJSR template in `PixInsightService`

### Alternative UI
- Core/Infrastructure layers are UI-agnostic
- Could build Console app, Blazor, or API using same services
- ViewModels use CommunityToolkit.Mvvm (portable)
